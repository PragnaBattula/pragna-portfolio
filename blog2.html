            <h2 class="h2">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="para">
                There are times where we have to store some important information online which includes passwords,bank
                credentials and more.Although we can use email or online office suites like google docs, to save text
                but these solutions are not safe . In my case, I'll write somewhere in the notes and I forget, this
                happens to me always and I even write in the notepad app which is available in the desktop.
                But I like to keep a folder because I wanna store so many things in a particular but it doesn’t work, 
                doing this it take up storage and sometimes if my device is not working, I cant access my text which I 
                saved.So Im wandering in online to search of a certain app which can solve my issues then I came across 
                this online webservice called ProtectedText.It is a web notepad, which comes handy online.
            </p>
            <h2 class="h2">What is ProtectedText?</h2>
            <p class="para">
                ProtectedText is a free, encrypted notepad to save notes online.It is a free web service where you can
                write down your texts, encrypt them and access them from anywhere from any device.This website lets the 
                user safely to store all textual content online. It is that simple. All you need is a web browser 
                in an Internet-enabled device.
            </p>
           
            <h2 class="h2">How does it work?</h2>
            <p class="para">
                Each unique notepad has a unique URL, which is further secured by a unique user generated password. Your
                notes are encrypted using your password, which never leaves your browser. Only the encrypted notes go to
                ProtectedText’s servers. ProtectedText doesn’t even maintain browser cookies between sessions. This means
                that even if you accidentally or willingly close your browser while adding notes, your notes remain safe. 
                Sounds pretty amazing, doesn’t it? 
            </p>

            <h2 class="h2">Is it safe?</h2>
            <p class="para">
                As we are storing our important or any kind of a text, we can get a question that <strong>is it safe to trust this site?</strong>
                Well the answer is YES!!! We can trust this web service. The reason is.. 
                ProtectedText site doesn't require any personal information and doesn't store the passwords. There is
                no ads, no cookies, no user tracking and no registration. No one can view the notes except those who
                have the password to decrypt the text. Since there is no user registration required, you don't need to
                create any accounts on this site. Once you done typing the notes, just save and close the web browser and you're
                good to go!
            </p>

            <h2 class="h2">How it encrypts?</h2>
            <p class="para">
                ProtectedText.com uses standard AES algorithm for encrypting/decrypting the content, together with
                'salts' and other known good practices to achieve exceptional security; and SHA512 algorithm for
                hashing. On top of that, all data is only provided through SSL.The encryption is handled by a main.js
                file which encrypts and decrypts the content locally, so the plaintext should never be stored on the
                server.
             </p>

            <h2 class="h2">Pros and Cons</h2>
            <p class="para">The Pros:</p>
            <ul class="para">
                <li>Your password isn't sent to the server, it can't decrypt your text even if they wanted to. Only
                    encrypted text is sent over the Internet.</li>
                <li>No logging in or out, just close the browser tab and you're safe.</li>
                <li>No ads because they can track you, and they're distracting.</li>
                <li>If someone wants your text, he'll need your password, but he have to find your site first.</li>

                <li>You can create many tabs in a particular site. </li>
            </ul>
