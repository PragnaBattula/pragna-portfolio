            <h2 class="h2">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="para">
                Have u ever imagined that why most companies use <strong>.com </strong> as an extension.
                Lately, when Im surfing over internet I observed that mostly all websites use <strong>.com </strong> as an extension.
                Then some questions are popping on my mind that why <strong>.com </strong>? why not other domains? 
                Let us know about <strong>.com </strong><br>
                

            </p>
        
           
            <h2 class="h2">Why companies prefer <strong>.com </strong>?</h2>
            
                    <ul class="para">
                        <li>Most people will assume that your website ends in .com</li> 

                           <li>Owning a .com domain lends credibility to your brand</li> 
                            
                            
                           <li>The .com has no TLD specific rules tied to it</li>
                    </ul>
                <h2 class="h2">Google loves <strong>.com </strong> domain</h2>
            <p class="para">
                The <strong>.com </strong> domain extension is by far the most used and valuable domain suffix. Put bluntly, Google is
                biased towards websites with <strong>.com </strong> TLD.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although businesses may wonder why <strong>.com </strong> is still afforded so much authority by Google. The answer is
                within human interaction with the search engine, that’s easy and familiar.
                <br>
                <br>
                A website with the domain name yourbusiness<strong>.com </strong> is likely to be afforded more authority by Google than
                yourbusiness.co.uk or yourbusiness.business because users are more likely to type in yourbusiness<strong>.com </strong>
                than yourbusiness.co.uk or any other TDL for that matter.
                <br>
                <br>

                 Which is what leads many businesses to seek their domain name with a less popular suffix. This might
                seem reasonable for branding purposes could be detrimental to your site’s online visibility.

            <h2 class="h2">Pros and Cons</h2>
            <p class="para">
             The Pros:
            </p>
            <ul class="para">
                <li>Memorability</li>
                <li>Brandability</li>
                <li>Appeals to Global Audience</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para">
             The Cons:
            </p>
            <ul class="para">
                <li><strong>.com </strong> Domains Are So Expensive.</li>
                <li>Limited Availability.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2 class="h2">Is there any Alternative..</h2>
            <p class="para">
                A .net extension is a popular option that’s often recommended to buyers whenever the desired <strong>.com </strong> domain
                is taken. The .net stands for ‘network’ and was originally designed for umbrella websites that serve
                smaller sites, such as web hosting companies.
                <br>
                <br>
                If the <strong>.com </strong> name you want isn’t available, find out if the current owner is in the same industry before
                settling for a .net. That’s because you don’t want your customers becoming there’s.
                <br>
                <br>
                In general, the .net extension is trusted and perceived as authoritative by consumers. It’s also been
                around enough that people can easily remember it.
                <br>
                <br>
                From the SEO end of things, .net is better than other specialty extensions. But since it isn’t quite up
                there with <strong>.com </strong> and .org extensions, you might not get the same benefits as using those alternatives.
                If your ideal <strong>.com </strong> name isn’t available, .net is typically a strong second choice.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, .net isn’t a good option for your business in most cases.
                The <strong>"com" </strong>in the <strong>.com </strong> domain name indicates a “commercial” site. This can cover business websites,
                websites that want to make money online, personal websites, blogs, portfolios, and more
                <br>
                <br>
                On the other hand, the “net” in the .net domain name extension stands for “network”. It was designed for
                the internet, networking, and email service providers.
            </p>
       
            <h2 class="h2">The Bottom Line..</h2>
            <p class="para">
    
                Having a website with a <strong>.com </strong>domain improves
                credibility and reliability. The <strong>.com </strong> domain is used for commercial businesses, even sartup companies can use this as it
                creates some brand .It makes easy for people to serach with <strong>.com </strong> as everyone thinks that a website ends with a <strong>.com </strong>
                domain. Google’s only reason to prioritize one extension over the other is that Internet users default to <strong>.com </strong>
                domains. In fact, more than 50 percent of all websites on the web use the <strong>.com </strong> extension.
