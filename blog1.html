            <h2 class="h2">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="para">
                Have u ever imagined that why most companies use <strong>.com </strong> as an extension.
                Lately, when Im surfing over internet I observed that mostly all websites use <strong>.com </strong> as an extension.
                Then some questions are popping on my mind that why <strong>.com </strong>? why not other? Before knowing about why first
                let us know about <strong>.com </strong><br>
                <strong>.com </strong> was introduced as one of the first top-level domains (TLDs) when the Domain Name System (DNS) was
                first implemented for use on the internet in January 1985. Originally created to represent the
                “commercial” intent of a website, <strong>.com </strong> has since been at the epicenter of the digital revolution that
                has reshaped the way people work, live, play and connect with family and friends.

            </p>
        
            <h2 class="h2">Brief History</h2>
            <p class="para">The domain <strong>.com </strong>was one of the first set of top-level domains when the Domain Name
                System was first implemented for use on the Internet on January 1, 1985.The domain was administered 
                by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), however, the department contracted the domain maintenance to 
                SRI International.
                <br>
                <br>

                January 1, 1993, the National Science Foundation assumed responsibility of maintenance, as com was
                primarily being used for non-defense interests.In the English language, the domain is often spelled with
                a leading period and commonly pronounced as dot-com, and has entered common parlance this way.
                <br>
                <br>

                Although <strong>.com </strong> domains were initially intended to designate commercial entities, the domain had
                no restrictions for eligible registrants since the mid-1990s. With the commercialization and
                popularization of the Internet, the domain was opened to the public and quickly became the most 
                common top-level domain for websites, email, and networking. <br />
                Many companies that flourished in the period from 1997 to 2001 the time known as the "dot-com bubble"
                incorporated the label com into company names; these became known as dot-coms or dot-com companies. 
                The introduction of biz in 2001, which is restricted to businesses, had no impact on the popularity of com.
            <br>
            <br>

                Many non-commercial sites and networks use <strong>.com </strong> names to benefit from the perceived recognizability 
                of a com domain. As of March 2009, VeriSign reported that 926 accredited registrars serve the domain.
                In December 2011, VeriSign reported that approximately 100 million com domains were registered.
                On November 29, 2012, the U.S. Department of Commerce approved the renewal of the com Registry Agreement 
                between Verisign, Inc., and ICANN. According to the Domain Name Industry Brief published in March 2020, 
                which publishes every quarter, com domain registration totaled 145.4 million.

            <h2 class="h2">Why companies prefer <strong>.com </strong>?</h2>
            <p class="para">Overwhelming majority of websites use <strong>.com </strong> for their Internet presence.With the advent of the <strong>.com </strong> as 
                an extension quickly skyrocketed ahead of all other alternatives.Today, over three decades later, 
                it has become the go-to for nearly all major brands. In fact, investors and companies alike continue 
                to pay tens of thousands and even well into the millions for premium <strong>.com </strong> domain names. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    <strong> Most people will assume that your website ends in .com </strong> <br>
                    Because of the overwhelming market share of <strong>.com </strong>, particularly with major corporations, most of the
                    Internet-using public (including your would-be customer-base) has grown accustomed to assuming a
                    company’s website is their brand name followed by <strong>.com </strong>. Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook,
                    Google—the list goes on.
                <br>
                <br>
                   <strong>Owning a <strong>.com </strong> domain lends credibility to your brand</strong><br>
                    The Internet has embraced over a thousand alternative domain extensions by now, but many people
                    still aren’t familiar with the new ones. Of course, this is in some ways due to such a
                    disproportional amount of the big business being done online through a select few top level domains
                    such as the Dotcom.<br>

                    When you see <strong>.com </strong> next to somebody’s brand, it relays a sense of credibility. Arguably, this
                    supposed credibility is entirely misguided and largely superficial, as there are plenty of <strong>.com </strong>
                    websites that are used for less than credible purposes.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                        <strong>The .com has no TLD specific rules tied to it</strong><br>
                        While this fact is also true for many TLDs including gTLDs (again, generic top-level domains)
                        and ccTLD (country code top-level domains), some TLD’s come with strings attached. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For example,if you wanted to register a .us or .ca, you’d have to actually live in the United States
                        or Canada, respectively. If you wanted to register a .nyc, you’d have to prove your residency in
                        New York City. Other domain extensions have Acceptable Use Policy agreements that you must abide
                        by. These can include content restrictions or limitations. Always research your desired TLD
                        rules (if any) before making a major brand decision around it.
                        
                    </p>
        
                <h2 class="h2">Google loves <strong>.com </strong> domain</h2>
            <p class="para">
                The <strong>.com </strong> domain extension is by far the most used and valuable domain suffix. Put bluntly, Google is
                biased towards websites with <strong>.com </strong> TLD.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although businesses may wonder why <strong>.com </strong> is still afforded so much authority by Google. The answer is
                within human interaction with the search engine. Cognitive fluency favours a top level domain (TLD)
                that’s easy and familiar.
                <br>
                <br>
                A website with the domain name yourbusiness<strong>.com </strong> is likely to be afforded more authority by Google than
                yourbusiness.co.uk or yourbusiness.business because users are more likely to type in yourbusiness<strong>.com </strong>
                than yourbusiness.co.uk or any other TDL for that matter.
                <br>
                <br>
                As <strong>.com </strong> domains are the most powerful, they have become more popular. As with custom licence plates or
                the new fad food, this has led to an increase in competition for the best <strong>.com </strong> domains. Many <strong>.com </strong>
                domains are now only available at a premium price, or will already be taken, meaning finding your ideal
                <strong>.com </strong> domain can be difficult.
                <br>
                <br>

                 Which is what leads many businesses to seek their domain name with a less popular suffix. This might
                seem reasonable for branding purposes could be detrimental to your site’s online visibility.

                <li>Appeals to Global Audience</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para">
             The Cons:
            </p>
            <ul class="para">
                <li><strong>.com </strong> Domains Are So Expensive.</li>
                <li>Limited Availability.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2 class="h2">Is there any Alternative..</h2>
            <p class="para">
                A .net extension is a popular option that’s often recommended to buyers whenever the desired <strong>.com </strong> domain
                is taken. The .net stands for ‘network’ and was originally designed for umbrella websites that serve
                smaller sites, such as web hosting companies.
                <br>
                <br>
                If the <strong>.com </strong> name you want isn’t available, find out if the current owner is in the same industry before
                settling for a .net. That’s because you don’t want your customers becoming there’s.
                <br>
                <br>
                In general, the .net extension is trusted and perceived as authoritative by consumers. It’s also been
                around enough that people can easily remember it.
                <br>
                <br>
                From the SEO end of things, .net is better than other specialty extensions. But since it isn’t quite up
                there with <strong>.com </strong> and .org extensions, you might not get the same benefits as using those alternatives.
                If your ideal <strong>.com </strong> name isn’t available, .net is typically a strong second choice.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, .net isn’t a good option for your business in most cases.
                The <strong>"com" </strong>in the <strong>.com </strong> domain name indicates a “commercial” site. This can cover business websites,
                websites that want to make money online, personal websites, blogs, portfolios, and more
                <br>
                <br>
                On the other hand, the “net” in the .net domain name extension stands for “network”. It was designed for
                the internet, networking, and email service providers.
            </p>
       
            <h2 class="h2">The Bottom Line..</h2>
            <p class="para">
    
                Having a website with a <strong>.com </strong>domain improves
                credibility and reliability. The <strong>.com </strong> domain is used for commercial businesses, even sartup companies can use this as it
                creates some brand .It makes easy for people to serach with <strong>.com </strong> as everyone thinks that a website ends with a <strong>.com </strong>
                domain. Google’s only reason to prioritize one extension over the other is that Internet users default to <strong>.com </strong>
                domains. In fact, more than 50 percent of all websites on the web use the <strong>.com </strong> extension.
